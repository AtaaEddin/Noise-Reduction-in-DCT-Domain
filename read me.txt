1) create empty functions files for all the function with the same names ex: dct_nr.m 

2) make sure that all the files are in the created project at the same level (all the files must see each others).

3) after you call the imread function run the dct_nr function with your image and let the second parameters be 1

but you can play with but it must be in the [0,1] domain.
